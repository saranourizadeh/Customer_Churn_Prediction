# Customer_Churn_Prediction

I used a dataset in Kaggle to improve my knowladge in Data Science and used XGBoost, RandomForrestand and SupportVector Classifier to predict churning.
there lots of more things to do in puprpose of increasing accurcy for prediction. here is some tips:

1. using neural network to predict.
2. using more data to predict (this dataset was small and I used it to learn.)
3. some hyper parameter tuning or implementing more algorithm can be resulted in finding better accuracy.
